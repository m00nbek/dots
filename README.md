# Dot files
m00nbek's configuration files for macOS

## Setup
Give executable permission and run the script
```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
Go ahead and watch a 12 episode "something". It'll be ready until then.

### Neofetch
If there's gap in neofetch:

1. In iterm2 navigate to Preferences > Advanced <br />
2. Search for: `Disable potentially insecure escape sequences` and set to `false` <br />
3. Search for: `Show inline images at retina resolution` and set to `false` <br />

### Notes
1. Some of the `brew` packages require password! <br />
2. Disable SIP in order to use yabai.  <br />
3. If `sketchybar` keeps asking you to install `Command Line Tools`:
```
sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```
4. If you run into any problem, fix it, lol. <br />
5. Please don't look at the screenshots if you're allergic to anime. <br />
